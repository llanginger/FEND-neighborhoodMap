<p>&#8220;Take Me Somewhere New&#8221; is a webapp designed to facilitate discovering new places to eat/drink/etc. Once the user inputs their location and the kind of thing they&#8217;re looking for, the app queries FourSquare&#8217;s api to give a list of venues in the area. The user can then remove from the list any places they recognize, hit the &#8220;Take me there&#8221; button and be presented with a random venue.</p>

<p>The purpose of this project was to learn how to use an MV* framework (Knockout.js in this case) as well as multiple 3rd party apis and AJAX requests in order to build a cohesive experience.</p>

<p>The app is hosted on gh-pages <a href="http://llanginger.github.io/FEND-neighborhoodMap/">here:</a></p>

<p>Having learned a lot about not only performance but also more comprehensive styling best practices since making this, I intend on overhauling the look and feel of the app, whilst keeping most of the backend roughly similar. Updates will be posted!</p>
